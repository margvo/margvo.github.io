We should create a client application in which the user should answer quiz-questions with limited time for thinking.

## Requirements

* The application must be written in vanilla javascript
* Usability first
* The application must be able to handle the different types of questions/answers that the server provide/handle.
* For every question there should be a timer counting down from 20 seconds to 0 seconds.
* The client application should also keep track of the total time the user takes to answer all the questions.
* The user should be able to choose a nickname at the start of the game that will be used in the high-score list.
* Application should use Web Storage to store a high-score list which presents the five fastest total times (on that specific client) at the end of the game. At least nickname and total time should be present.
