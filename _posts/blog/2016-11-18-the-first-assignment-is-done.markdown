My first assignment for the course 1DV022 is done! I have always wanted to create a black and white website and today I achieved that goal.
I am satisfied with my result, everything looks how I planned it. I hope you like it too. The only thing that is left to do is to
publish my website on GitHub Pages. Good luck to me!
