This is my first post where I just want to impress you with my Markdown skills. At the moment I'm writing this post, I'm 5 days away (time sure does fly) from deadline to submit the first assignment in the course "Client-based Web programming".

This is what I have done so far:

* configuration
* head, header
* navigation
* footer

I'd better hurry! But on the other hand, I see [Clara Schumann](https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clara_Schumann)'s quote

>Why hurry over beautiful things? Why not linger and enjoy them?

And then I ask myself the same question...
