        <p>I'm glad to welcome you to my website. As you can guess by the name, Task Storage aims to collect assignments in order to organize the studying process.
        To be more specific, the website stores the assignments in the course "<a target="_blank" href="https://coursepress.lnu.se/kurs/klientbaserad-webbprogrammering/">Client-based Web Programming</a>" (and some other courses to come) at Linnaeus university in Sweden.
        In this course we learn how to build a website with the Static Site Generator Jekyll and how to create applications for the web browser.</p>

        <p>Besides the assignments  you can find some information about me or read some of my breathtaking posts in the blog section. Feel free to comment on any point made there.</p>

        <p>If you have any questions, recommendations, remarks or just feel lonely please do not hesitate to contact me.</p>

        <p class="sign">Kind regards,</p>
