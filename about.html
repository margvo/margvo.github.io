        <p>My name is Maria. I'm 28 years old. I was born and grew up in Moscow region, Russia. In 2014 I moved to Sweden and I'm excited to have the opportunity to study at Linnaeus University. I have a Master's degree in History and Tourism and even though  I'm humanity by education I have
        always been fascinated by technologies and computers that is why I have chosen the Software Development programme as my second higher education.</p>

        <p>As for my hobbies,  I like travelling but lately I don't have too much time for it. Education takes up all my attention: besides university courses I'm taking a couple of additional courses in computer-related areas,
        trying to learn Swedish and practice on English while preparing for taking driving license at the same time. One  can say I'm quite thirst for knowledge.</p>

        <p>In the rare hours of peace and freedom I like to check some nice horror or soviet film (what can I do,  I was born in the USSR...), to explore new music (hip-hop, electronic and ethnic is in focus), to visit some
        art exhibition or just to chat with my wonderful family.</p>
